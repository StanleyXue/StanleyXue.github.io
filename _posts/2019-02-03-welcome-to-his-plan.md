This book is based on true testimonies and bears witness to the power of Jesus in the Christian life. It was written by faith through the leading of the Holy Spirit.

I would like to dedicate this book to the Lord. I also donate this book to brother Abraham and Joshua’s ministry. May they freely use it in their continued ministry to impact the nations. 

Also, any mission organization and church can request distribution rights of this book from me. I hope to see the proceeds from this book be used as seed sown into the mission field to promote the name of Christ Jesus and His message of the cross to impact the nations.

May the name of our Lord Jesus Christ be exalted and glorified!
