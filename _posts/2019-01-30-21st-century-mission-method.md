## Background
The 21st Century Mission Method, is the way Jesus does His mission and trains His disciples. This method is also called “Sacrificial Succession”. It is biblically based and different from the traditional way of doing mission: a naturally sustainable, highly effective and low-cost way of doing mission work on a large scale to impact a nation.

This mission method not only helps you effectively evangelise within a difficult mission environment, but also creates unity among different denominations of the Church to promote Christ sacrificially. God is using churches to display His manifold wisdom. 

The table below shows the exponential growth of a Pioneering Project in a Buddhist Nation where the strategy of ‘Sacrificial Succession’ was applied in Abraham’s mission organization, where the Holy Spirit brought forth the fruit through the hard work of Joshua's labour. In this mission method, we call indigenous missionaries “Pioneers”, the disciples of the Pioneer are called “Successors”, mission partners are the local churches of the nation being impacted.

## Pioneer method — Sacrificial Succession
Sacrificial Succession sits at the heart of the Pioneer Method. Jesus' leadership was based on servanthood. As Christians, we are called to do the same. 
In the book of Matthew Jesus described a sacrificial life to His disciples. Matthew 20:28, “even as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many”.  He also said: “… whoever would be great among you must be your servant, and whoever would be first among you must be your slaves” (Matthew 20:26-27). A sacrificial leader must encompass two qualities. The willingness to serve others and the willingness to sacrifice everything to do so. 
Within the Pioneer Method the missionary is renamed a Pioneer. The disciples of a Pioneer are called Successors. Mission work is referred to as Pioneer work and the local church are Pioneering Partners. The mission is called a Pioneering Project.


## Pioneering Purpose   
The mission purpose is to trigger the local church into beginning a movement of mission for Christ. It is also to provide a sustainable model for church leaders to undertake evangelism and discipleship. 
To impact a nation deeply and widely, two activities must regularly occur within the church: (1) participation in training local Pioneer leaders, (2) the use of sustainable methods for evangelism and discipleship activities. 
A Pioneering Project requires an exit strategy at the beginning. This means a transitional plan must be in place to ensure newly established churches will be sustainable. This will allow the church to continue its mission movement after the mission organization has left. Therefore, the Pioneer Method requires a timeline.


## Pioneer Life Cycle
Pioneering work is not a permanent task. The suggested life cycle for a project is seven years. During this life cycle the transition from the mission organization to local church ownership is planned and outworked as follows:
