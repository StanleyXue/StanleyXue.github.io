## Background
The 21st Century Mission Method, is the way Jesus does His mission and trains His disciples. This method is also called “Sacrificial Succession”. It is biblically based and different from the traditional way of doing mission: a naturally sustainable, highly effective and low-cost way of doing mission work on a large scale to impact a nation.
<!–-break-–>

This mission method not only helps you effectively evangelise within a difficult mission environment, but also creates unity among different denominations of the Church to promote Christ sacrificially. God is using churches to display His manifold wisdom. 

The table below shows the exponential growth of a Pioneering Project in a Buddhist Nation where the strategy of ‘Sacrificial Succession’ was applied in Abraham’s mission organization, where the Holy Spirit brought forth the fruit through the hard work of Joshua's labour. In this mission method, we call indigenous missionaries “Pioneers”, the disciples of the Pioneer are called “Successors”, mission partners are the local churches of the nation being impacted.

## Pioneer method — Sacrificial Succession
Sacrificial Succession sits at the heart of the Pioneer Method. Jesus' leadership was based on servanthood. As Christians, we are called to do the same. 
In the book of Matthew Jesus described a sacrificial life to His disciples. Matthew 20:28, “even as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many”.  He also said: “… whoever would be great among you must be your servant, and whoever would be first among you must be your slaves” (Matthew 20:26-27). A sacrificial leader must encompass two qualities. The willingness to serve others and the willingness to sacrifice everything to do so. 
Within the Pioneer Method the missionary is renamed a Pioneer. The disciples of a Pioneer are called Successors. Mission work is referred to as Pioneer work and the local church are Pioneering Partners. The mission is called a Pioneering Project.


## Pioneering Purpose   
The mission purpose is to trigger the local church into beginning a movement of mission for Christ. It is also to provide a sustainable model for church leaders to undertake evangelism and discipleship. 
To impact a nation deeply and widely, two activities must regularly occur within the church: (1) participation in training local Pioneer leaders, (2) the use of sustainable methods for evangelism and discipleship activities. 
A Pioneering Project requires an exit strategy at the beginning. This means a transitional plan must be in place to ensure newly established churches will be sustainable. This will allow the church to continue its mission movement after the mission organization has left. Therefore, the Pioneer Method requires a timeline.


### Pioneer Life Cycle
Pioneering work is not a permanent task. The suggested life cycle for a project is seven years. During this life cycle the transition from the mission organization to local church ownership is planned and outworked as follows:

### Church Partner Commitment
For a Mission Project to be sustainable, local church partners need to make the following commitments:
•	Prayer partners confirm the opportunity for a spiritual harvest.
•	Local church partners agree to work together to impact their nation.
•	Local Pioneers are willing to lead sacrificial lives for the targeted people.

### The Power of Unity 
The vital strength of Pioneer work is the involvement of the local church regardless of denomination. Although working inter-denominationally can sometimes be challenging it will produce unbelievable blessings. The practice of unity does bear fruit and release spiritual power.
The church is the body of Christ. His true reflection. His bride. Therefore, a mission organization must establish a relationship with the church to outwork its mission calling. Church partners provide many important roles in the pioneering work. A mission organization cannot work with Pioneers or church partners who are unwilling to unite. 

## Pioneering Steps

### Pioneer vision
God usually puts a vision to pioneer a particular nation into His servant’s heart. Without His calling, the mission organization will labor in vain，not pleasing God. As Jesus taught His disciples, “Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of his own accord, but only what he sees the Father doing. For whatever the Father does, that the Son does likewise.” (John 5:19) Therefore, we must, like Jesus, receive a mission vision from God. This is a basic principle of the Pioneer Method. 
However, confirmation is needed before beginning a Pioneering Project to impact a nation. It must be ascertained by prayer that the mission organization or church need to impact that particular nation. This is done via the church intercessors and mission organization leaders. 
During this time also seek local churches or international intercessors to confirm the need for the nation to be impacted. This confirmation is the foundation for a Pioneering Project to begin.

### Spy out the land
After receiving a vision, a mission organization must do a feasibility study. Spy out the land (Joshua 2:1). They can network and get connected to the local churches within the nation they are about to impact. One could also use the church network around the world to get connected with the local church. Because God is doing a mighty work all over the world, He has already established His churches everywhere. 
Jesus said to His disciples: “…My Father is working until now, and I am working.” (John5:17) Through the churches, Pioneers will gain a better understanding of the land. The true spiritual atmosphere as well as the political and legal condition of the nation. They will receive a better perspective of what can or cannot be done. What is legal or illegal in that nation. They will learn how to receive spiritual and legal support and covering by the local church. Also, they can investigate whether the political stability of the nation presents an opportunity for pioneering or not. 
The mission organization motivates the local church to intercede and pray for the Project. The mission organization's own intercessor and church also pray. This is done to seek confirmation of God’s timing and detailed instruction. This confirmation is required during this period of time.
On this initial trip the mission organization's research should include: 
•	Are there any churches willing to pioneer their local people? 
•	Are there any local church partners available? 
•	Are these local churches willing to make a commitment to impact their own people and to provide Pioneers for the mission?  
•	Finally, the Pioneer can work towards establishing legal protection and spiritual covering.  
### Two kinds of covering
Pioneering for the kingdom is very different from pioneering in the business world. It requires two types of covering. 
•	The spiritual covering must come from local churches. Church is God’s established government on earth, it has spiritual power and authority. The local church does not only provide covering for the Pioneers but can also help them avoid any crooked paths. This allows the ministry planted in good soil to establish a solid foundation right away. This also allows finances to be better used in His Kingdom to bless His ministry, and in turn the Lord will bless those who sow blessing into His kingdom. Therefore, the mission organization needs to seek spiritual covering from the local church. 
•	Worldly protection is also very important. However, it is not in seeking local government or government officials’ protection only. That is not biblical. Worldly protection can be established via the legal system to allow Pioneers to operate under the protection of local law. 
This is especially so when pioneering in Muslim nations. It is in the Project’s best interest to avoid any undesired attention or financial pressure from local governments or government officials, because before a Muslim accepts Jesus he is anti-Christ, living under lies with hatred and animosity towards Christians.
Ultimately true covering comes from God, thus depend on God not man. 

### Research strategy
The purpose of research is to confirm spiritually whether to be involved in a Pioneer Project. Below are questions that require prayer: 

•	Is it the correct time to establish a Pioneering Project in this nation? 
•	Which people group should be impacted first in this nation? Where is the people group located? Who are the church partners? 
•	Are there local Pioneers willing to embrace the challenge to go, to serve, to sacrifice for and sustain this people group? 
•	Once the Pioneers and church partners willing to work with the mission organization are found, what is the cost?  How much are the church partners willing to contribute?  Who will carry the costs? 
This initial research determines whether there are suitable local church partners willing to pioneer their nation and provide Pioneers for the project.
The next step in research is to determine what nation needs to be impacted first:  
•	If this nation is being impacted by the gospel, would it have the ability and potential to impact surrounding nations?  
•	Would the potential church partner provide Pioneers and intercessors?  
•	Is the local Pioneer able to establish spiritually and financially sustainable churches? 
Further detailed research lists are provided during training. 

### Connecting with local churches 
After confirming the above check list, the second trip will focus on building a closer spiritual relationship with the local pioneering churches. 
It is important to share the detailed pioneer plan with the partner churches. This process requires: a reliance upon the Holy Spirit’s leading through love towards the nation; commitment to the pioneer plan; faith in God; a desire to deeply impact the local church; sharing in the power of working together with the church. One can expect during this trip to establish a partner relationship with a church by the signing of a memorandum. 
Apostle Paul understood the truth of working through the church to accomplish his mission, so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places (Ephesian 3:10). 
To impact a nation successfully, cooperation with the church is vital. The local church provides both the Pioneers for the mission and oversight for the mission work.  Only in cooperation with the church can the mission organization begin to interview potential local Pioneers. Train them through the Sacrificial Succession method to become leaders and promote the mission work locally.
The role of church partners：
•	To be focused on prayer and intercession to confirm the time, people group and location of the Pioneering Project. 
•	Provide a national church partner to lead and monitor the detailed pioneering work.
•	To contribute Pioneers and pastors for the upcoming pioneering and pastoral work. 
•	To accept, take over and pastor the newly established fellowship groups and local churches.
•	Ensure the sustainability of newly established churches.
The key to starting a Pioneer Project is the confirmation of the local church partner's commitment. This is done by formally signing a memorandum to pioneer the nation together. It is important for both parties to have an agreed framework detailing how to start, grow and end a Pioneer Project together.   

### Deciding on the outreach target group
Acts 1:8 Jesus said: ... And you will be my witnesses, telling people about me everywhere—in Jerusalem, throughout Judea, in Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.” Different versions of the Bible all use the word ‘and’ to connect Samaria to the ends of the earth and not a ‘comma’. This is significant because ‘and’ is used as a bridge to connect one thing to the other. A ‘comma’ is used to separate one thing from the other. Often, it’s hard to reach the Samaritan people groups (Muslim, Buddhist, Aboriginal, American Indian), thus people ignore them and choose other nations and people groups who are ‘easier’. 
However, to impact a nation there is an important biblical principle. The Samaritan people cannot be ignored. They are part of the great commission and part of the ‘ends of the earth’ process. Jesus shows us His heart for the Samaritan people. He first revealed His Messiah identity to the Samaritan woman at the well (John 4:26).  
Samaritan people were looked down upon by the Jews, they were less than dogs, not worthy of receiving the gospel. But Jesus made His disciples understand that the gospel must come to the lowly people first. 
Likewise, many of Jesus’ successors were fisherman, the lowest people group in Jewish society. But Jesus trained them to be the first-generation successors. Therefore, the important principle to successfully impact a nation is to preach to the local “Samaritan” people first.  
Like the great apostle Paul, he is a ‘Hebrew’s Hebrew’, (Philippians 3:5) called by the Lord to be the apostle for the Gentiles (Ephesians 3:1). These gentiles were despised by the Jews, like the Samaritan people were despised. According to the Jews they are not worthy to receive the gospel. But Paul was chosen to preach the gospel with these downtrodden people first. 
   
Today, this kind of prejudice still exists. But we must find the last and the least according to these spiritual principles and preach the gospel to them. Through communication and intercession with the church, to confirm who the ‘Samaritan’ people are in the nation. Once confirmed, Pioneers can make them their target group to reach. Evangelism and discipleship of these ‘Samaritan people first’ will have a huge impact in their nation.
  
### Establish a pioneer plan
Pioneer plans are established according to each location and situation. A monthly gospel outreach target is set. This is done with the help of the church partner and agreed upon by the local Pioneer. The church is involved in both the planning and monitoring role from the beginning. This establishes a stable church partner's management role and the Pioneer’s accountability. Pioneers are to send monthly reports to the church.  
The Pioneer plan also includes:
•	Which target nation or people group to impact?
•	Support structure from church partners.
•	Number of supported National Pioneers.  
•	Approved management and transition plan.
•	Set Pioneer target with sending church.

### Seven-year Pioneer work outline  
There are at least two cycles in a seven-year period. During this time, a Pioneer should establish three generations of local Pioneers. The founding Pioneer's role changes during this time from servant to sacrifice to sustainer. 
Each role is described in the chart below：

## Pioneer Selection Criteria
The key to a successful mission project is to find the called Pioneers. We believe that God has already prepared His people for mission work. Our job is to find them and to equip them. 

### Calling
The most important trait of a Pioneer is their calling by God to impact a nation, " … for you shall cause this people to inherit the land …" (Joshua1:6), and they must be committed to pay the price for the sake of preaching the gospel. The great apostle Paul shared this certainty in the book of Romans, “and thus I make it my ambition to preach the gospel, not where Christ has already been named, lest I build on someone else’s foundation, but as it is written, “ Those who have never been told about him will see, and those who have never heard will understand.” (Romans15:20-21) For He opens doors for His called one.

### Know the Word and led by the Holy Spirit
To know God is to know His Word, for God’s Person and redemptive love is revealed in and through His Word.  Knowing the Word is important in discipleship, it is the Word that trains the heart of new believers in the new and living way of faith energized by love to leave behind the old life and press on to be a true disciple of Christ. “All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work”.  (2 Timothy 3:16-17) 
For pioneers to be effective and to bear fruits they need to abide in the Word. John 15:5: “I am the vine and you are the branches. whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing.” 
A Pioneer must be willing to carry the cross like Jesus and be led by the Holy Spirit. If they are self-centered, they cannot experience God’s promised abundant life in the mission field. 
“For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposite to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do.” (Galatians 5:17) The Holy Spirit is God with man. The Holy Spirit prepares the Pioneer for their calling. He is the one to give all understanding and experience. Multiplication in the harvest field comes from the leading of the Holy Spirit. Without His leading, Pioneers could not bear fruit a hundred-fold.  
The mission field is a spiritual battle ground. Pioneers are the prime target of the enemy. Winning the battle requires constant discernment, leading and encouragement from the Holy Spirit. 

### Spiritual insight
Another important trait for Pioneers is the ability to sense an opportunity for a spiritual harvest. Jesus explained this principle to His disciples, “Do you not say, ‘there are yet four months, then comes the harvest? Look, I tell you, lift up your eyes, and see that the fields are white for harvest. Already the one who reaps is receiving wages and gathering fruit for life eternal, so that sower and reaper may rejoice together.” (John 4:35-36)
When Pioneers have the ability to discern a divine opportunity they will courageously step out to advance their ministry work. They will be able to endure hardship with patience and perseverance. They will be ready to sacrifice their life for the harvest. There is no greater achievement than this for Christ. Without spiritual insight Pioneers will miss opportunities from God. This may cause the ministry to stagnate.

### Passion and ability
A Pioneer must have a heart for and a willingness to serve the lost. They must be burdened with love for the lost and their need to come to Christ. They must possess the ability and passion to preach the gospel to them. Without a commitment to seek the lost, what is taught is only head knowledge. Only love of the heart can truly impact the lost. Also, without passion Pioneers will stumble in times of trial.

### Pioneer gifts
Pioneers are like entrepreneurs.  They are sent out to non-Christian nations to pioneer God’s business for the kingdom. Pioneers are people who like to do new things. Initiate projects rather than managing them. Pioneer rather than plow. Establish foundations rather than building on top of. Sowing but not watering. This is because their gifts, calling, traits and commitments are different from those of a pastor. Now these are the gifts Christ gave to the church: “…the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the pastors and teachers. Their responsibility is to equip God’s people to do his work and build up the church, the body of Christ.” Ephesians 4:11-12
Pastors usually pay more attention to shepherding and building the body of Christ ------ the church. Ephesians 3:10, “so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places.”  Placing Pioneers and pastors in their correct role brings blessing to the church. Without the Pioneer, pioneering work would be a waste of time and energy and ultimately ineffective. 

A Pioneer’s gift is not the same as a pastor’s gift. The apostle Paul, a great pioneer knew his mission. In 1 Corinthians 3:6-10 Paul said: “I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the growth. So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth. He who plants and he who waters are one, and each will receive his wages according to his labor. For we are God’s fellow workers. You are God’s field, God’s building. According to the grace of God given to me, like a skilled master builder I laid a foundation, and someone else is building upon it. Let each one take care how he builds upon it.”  

### Ability to gather and train
Pioneers need to be able to gather people to impact a nation for Christ. This is especially important when dealing with different nationalities and religious groups. It requires effort and love to seek out a lost soul, share the gospel with them and lead by example. Paul learnt that to preach the mystery of Christ to the Gentiles he must first be sacrificial. He must love the Gentile and be willing to sacrifice himself for the sake of the gospel. 
To have a Sacrificial Succession, one must train the last and the least to be leader. Sacrificial Succession means to sacrifice leadership and everything for the Successor.  If Pioneers are unable to train local Pioneer Successors their impact will be very limited. The mission won’t expand or grow as quickly as desired.
 
### Humble and submissive
Pioneers are to be humbly willing to be equipped by the mission organization. Because Pioneers are like entrepreneurs, they are generally independent in nature, with a natural self-motivated ability. Therefore, humility and submission to the monitoring church is very important. Submission to and cooperation with the church allows Pioneers to be balanced by pastors. It will particularly benefit new believers to model the acceptance of pastoral authority, which enables them to transition into a healthy church life, also allowing them to grow into mature Christians and later become pastoral successors.  Submission also allows pastors to shepherd the pioneered fellowship into a healthy and sustainable church, bringing forth good fruit and preventing false teaching.  The Bible tells us, that though Paul clearly knew his calling was to preach the gospel to the Gentiles, he still asked the Antioch church to commission and send him. After prayer and fasting, yet he asked the leaders to lay hands on him and Timothy as a sign of their submission to the church of Jerusalem in Antioch (Acts 13:3).

### Suggested Pioneer life cycle
Based on the principles of sacrificing financial support and leadership, both monitored together with our local church partners and Pioneers, the recommended three-year pioneering cycle for each National Pioneer is as follows:
<table>
    <tr>
        <td colspan="2">Recommended Three-year Pioneering Cycle</td>    
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>SERVE (Years 1-3)

### Three key roles of a sacrificial leader
The three main roles of a sacrificial leader during the stages of succession are based on the actions of service, sacrifice and sustain. The roles are as follows:  
•	Servant who ministers to Successors (serving and being served) Matthew 20:26-27
•	Sacrificer who sacrifices for Successors (sacrificing and being sacrificed for) Matthew 20:28
•	Sustainer who stays on to help Successors (sustaining and being sustained) John 14:26
