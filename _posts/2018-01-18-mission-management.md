## The Importance of Management 
A successful business cannot be separated from its excellent management. Likewise, a successful mission is reflective of its effective management. The management system aids the success and speed of a mission project's development.
<!–-break-–>

Mission Management operates with church partnership. A mission organization is not a church and therefore needs the church. This joint collaboration is built upon biblical principles. Scripture states: “so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places” (Ephesians3:10).

## Purpose of Management 
The purpose of management is to be good stewards and gain maximum return for the kingdom. This empowers the mission for sustainability and growth. Scripture reminds us: “Everyone to whom much was given, of him much will be required: and from him to whom they entrusted much, they will demand the more.” (Luke 12:48)  
The Pioneers goal is not only to establish churches in a nation but to ultimately entrust the church to local leadership. The practical outworking of Sacrificial Succession requires three major factors. Good stewardship, church cooperation and a Pioneer’s calling.
  
### When Does Management Begin?
Management begins as soon as the Mission Project starts. Management is responsible for: a research plan, spiritual confirmation of the correct timing to initiate a project, confirmation of church partnership, running a pilot project, confirmation of local church unity, confirmation of the Pioneer's effectiveness, translation of documents, the supply of information and communication technologies, project management, the selection of national leaders, marketing and promotion, project transition and succession ceremony.

### Establish Pioneer Criteria 
•	Which target nation or people group to impact?
•	Support structure from the church partners.
•	Number of supported National Pioneers. 
•	Approved management and transition plan.

### Confirm the Church Partners
Since cooperation with the local church is vital, Mission Management need to confirm the church partner’s relationship. This is done via the following questions:
•	Are you willing to cooperate with us in this Pioneer Project? 
•	How will you cooperate in this Pioneer Project? 
•	How will the Pioneer Project benefit you? 
•	What challenged you to enter into this pioneering work? 

### Project Standard
While each Pioneer Project is unique there is still mission effectiveness criteria that is agreed upon before any project commences:
•	Timeline – Normally a 2-3 year per pioneer cycle with a total of 7 years. 
•	Scope  – Limits the Pioneer Project to impacting a specific country or nation, religious or people group.
•	Resources – Requires at least three forms of partnership: Project Managers, National Partners and Pioneers.     

### Setting Pioneer Target
Depending on the local situation, the Pioneer and board reach an agreement of achievement within a three-year period:  
•	How many areas does each Pioneer need to evangelize?
•	How many people from the target group need to be baptized?
•	How many meeting points should be established and how many people are required to attend?
•	How many Successors need to be trained to pioneer a new field?

## Management Structure
Having a clear management structure where the responsibilities of each partner are clearly defined helps keep everyone accountable and responsible. Within every project there are paid and volunteer roles that are fulfilled by mission organizations and their church partners. 
 
### Staff Structure
Depending on the size and scale of a project these are the main paid and volunteer roles: 
•	National Leaders (Volunteers) – Guide and advocate for the Mission Project to increase its national impact. 
•	Project Manager (Paid) – Leads and manages project at an international or national level. 
•	Project Coordinators (Paid) – Confirm mission effectiveness of National Pioneers and churches.  
•	Church Overseers (Volunteers) – Oversee National Pioneers and provide pastoral support.
•	National Pioneers (Paid) – Evangelize a nation and disciple Pioneer Successors.  

### Staff Requirement
Staff selection requires strong spiritual insight. Trained professionals with spiritual field experience are required to decide who should fill roles. 
Staff need professional training and spiritual experience to work effectively. The mission organization expects the Project Manager to be trustworthy and represent a high standard to all.  
For a Pioneers Project to be effective three key roles must be filled:
•	Staff from the pioneering organization who are spiritually and professionally able to manage a Mission Project.
•	Church partners who can oversee National Pioneers and the churches they plant.
•	National Pioneers who have proven their character, calling and commitment to pioneering.
 
### Volunteer Expert Advisors
Another vital role church partners play is offering expert advice in different fields. They can advise in matters of business and law, pastoral ministry and pioneering work as well as education and training. Church partners assist with the spiritual, educational and economic sustainability of a Mission Project. 
In most cases Volunteer National Advisors are drawn directly from the churches that partner with the mission organization. Their business, educational and spiritual wisdom and experience are invaluable. 

### Employment and Wages 
Paid personnel are supported based on the normal pay for that role minus 20%. The aim of paying less than the full amount is to encourage the church partners to provide the difference. 
Each supported Pioneer must be recruited by the Pioneer organization and overseen by a local church partner. A national leadership is then specifically formed to guide the Mission Project.

### Supporting Standard
First year Pioneers will receive 100% support. This support is reduced to 80% in the second year and 60% in the third. The reason for this is to cultivate local support from the church. When the mission organization leaves a nation, the Project will need to be self-sustaining to continue their pioneering work. 
If a Pioneer doesn't reach the set target the mission organization's support ends after the three-year period.
For a Pioneer who only reached the minimum target the mission organization will support 60% for a fourth year only. This is especially so if the Pioneer feels called to become a pastor. 
But if in three years the agreed target has doubled the mission organization will give 100% support in the second three-year cycle. An example of this would be a minimum of 24 people being baptised, 40 people attending meetings, 2 Successors and the Pioneers willing to step out and pioneer a new area. Finally, the respective church would be willing to release them for a new work.

### Structure and Function  
It is important to understand the way different personnel interact. Pioneering Projects run on the principle of “mutual accountability’. This means total transparency regarding both the cost of the project and the accountability of those involved.

</table>

Mutual accountability requires the Pioneer Project Manager and the Field Coordinator to monitor the Partners and Pioneers work to ensure it is effective. Monitoring a Pioneer Project has three tiers:
•	To be effective means to reach the spiritual and management target. 
•	Normally the Project Manager and Coordinators provide management oversight.
•	Partner sending church volunteers provide spiritual oversight to the Pioneers.

## Mission Effectiveness 
Mission Effectiveness is reported and evaluated in two main ways. 
•	Qualitatively – By understanding the success of the Pioneer activities through relationships and testimonies. 
•	Quantitatively – By measuring the success of the Pioneer Project through the data of numbers and statistics.
Qualitative reporting is carried out by all Project Partners especially the Pioneers. Pioneers share their work experiences through oral and written testimonies with a specific focus on their mission effectiveness. Project Managers, including mission organization staff and church overseers, check and add to the qualitative reports by confirming and collating them through scheduled field trips.     
Regularly confirming achievement of agreed mission effectiveness targets with Project Managers (at least annually) is a must.     
A Pioneer should be visited by a field coordinator at least three times a year. If possible, a visit by a different coordinator each time helps ensure a different perspective on the work undertaken and avoid any favoritism. Because visits do not occur often it is important that the right questions are asked regarding the mission effectiveness, especially in relation to new believers and Successors. 
The Mission Effectiveness report is based on set targets.
•	A start and finish date for each National Pioneer (usually 3 years).
•	Routine Mission Effectiveness reports by Project Partners (usually monthly).
•	Regularly confirming achievement of agreed mission targets with Project Managers (at least annually).  
The Mission Projects effectiveness is displayed through a Key Performance Indicator. The Mission Projects target is pre-set according to the local area's spiritual condition. The target is broken into two areas. One for the church partners and Pioneers and the other for the Project Manager and Coordinators. These targets are transparent, allowing for mutual responsibility. 
Evaluation of Local National Church Partners and Pioneers’ mission effectiveness is based on four Key Performance Areas in 10 key performance indicators:

</table>

Analysis of the Key Performance Indicators from these two sources will provide a picture of mission effectiveness. It is expected that each National Partner and Pioneer, Project Manager and Coordinator will be mutually responsible towards each other.   

### Stable Spiritual Principle, Flexible Field Practice 
Allowing Pioneers flexibility enables them to best utilize their time. Sometimes a Pioneer may wish to stay with a church after it has been established and not continue a new pioneer work. If the sending church agrees to this then the Pioneer is permitted to stay as long as they are self-sustained. But if the Pioneer is willing to pioneer a new area then, with the sending church’s approval, the sending church agrees to pioneer this new target area. The result is a new pioneering initiative.

### Cooperation Type  
For a mission organization to be involved in a Pioneer Project depends on the degree of financial and other support required.  There are three ways for a mission organization to get involved:
•	Mission organization initiates a Pioneer Project, fully funded by the mission organization. 
•	Mission organization and church initiate a Pioneering Project together and share the costs.
•	The church independently initiates a Pioneering Project. The mission organization is not directly involved but gives partial financial support.        
The different involvement structures use different management monitoring systems. Details of this are explained during training. Individuals can also contribute finance or prayer support through the mission organization or church.    

### Spiritual Oversight
Church partners provide a spiritual service and covering that the mission organization, as a para-church organization, cannot provide.  By overseeing the Pioneers and the churches they plant the church partner ultimately assists in the effectiveness of both the Project, the Pioneer and the Successor. Spiritual oversight via the church cultivates accountability and sustainability within a Mission Project.
 
## Accountability and Transparency
Mission Effectiveness Reports are completed by National Pioneers to ensure accountability and transparency. These reports are checked and signed off by the church partner overseeing the National Pioneer. The reports are then rechecked by the Project Manager on a monthly basis. A Field Coordinator will visit the National Pioneer three times a year to audit and evaluate whether the information they have reported is correct.

### Collecting Testimonies  
Collecting and sharing testimonies from the field is of utmost importance. It provides the prayer partners with fuel for praise and further prayer. Receiving personal testimonies from New Believers, National Pioneers, Pioneer and Pastoral Successors and Church Partners must be the top priority for all staff.
Each Pioneer is required to share, in writing and with pictures if possible, at least two testimonies a month from their mission fields. These testimonies form the basis for a monthly newsletter. It is the Project Manager’s responsibility to compile, translate and distribute the newsletter to both the national and international partners as well as mission organization management. This helps the mission organization and partners to pray and support the Pioneers more effectively.

### Interview Questions to Ask New Believers
Documenting the testimonies of new believers when they are baptised or being discipled is so encouraging for everyone involved. It is irrefutable evidence of a life touched. Three great questions to ask are:
•	How did you come to Christ?
•	What first drew you to Jesus?
•	How do you live out your faith?

### Question to ask National Pioneers / Pioneer Successors
It is a priority to identify National Pioneers and Successors that best represent the Pioneer Project. This can be done by hearing their personal testimony. Three great questions to ask are:
•	How were you called to pioneering work?
•	What is your vision for impacting a nation?
•	What challenges and opportunities do you face?  

### Question to Ask National Partners and Advisors
Because of the importance of working in partnership with the church it is important to gather testimonies from them as well. They are the ones who faithfully pray for and support the National Pioneer in innovative ways. The main questions to ask are:
•	How do you partner with us in this Pioneer Project? 
•	What are the benefits of this Pioneer Project to you?
•	What challenges does this Pioneer Project pose for you?

### Questions the Field Coordinator should ask the Pioneers   
The main questions to ask during a field trip and site visit are:
•	How much monthly financial support do you receive from the mission organization?
•	How much monthly financial support do you receive from non-mission organization sources?
•	How many people from the target people group have you evangelized?
•	How many of those evangelized were converted?
•	How many of the people you discipled were baptized?
•	In how many locations do you have meetings/outreach?
•	How many people attended your fellowships or services?
•	How many Pioneer Successors are you personally discipling?
•	Are any pastoral replacements ready to become pastors?
•	How many of your fellowships are self-sustaining churches?
•	In how many locations are you promoting this?
  
### Problem Solving 
In all pioneer work, there will be unavoidable problems. The most important thing is to have correct procedures in place for dealing with situations. Pioneers must faithfully maintain a good relationship with both their management and spiritual overseers within the local churches.
If a Pioneer faces spiritual issues a Project Manager must submit to the National Leader for their decision to pass relevant information on to the church partners. If any problem cannot be resolved after consulting the local authority all issues must be passed on to the mission organizations management department. It is then up to their spiritual adviser to make the final decision.
   
### Managing Crisis and Risks 
Mission Projects are inherently risky. This is because target areas are places with conflict or instability where the devil has a stronghold. Also, there are partnerships with relationship benefits and money involved. Therefore, all stakeholders: Project Managers, Local and National Church Partners as well as Pioneers and Advisors, must be involved in developing written action plans for dealing with crisis and risks within a Project.
The plan and principle is to live peaceably with all (Romans 12:8). Therefore, it is the job of the mission project team to anticipate risks that can endanger the project and its people and if possible avoid them.  

### Managing Crisis
If a crisis occurs it is the responsibility of senior leadership to deal with the issue immediately. This is done by:
•	Deciding on a specific plan of action to deal with the crisis at hand.
•	Identifying a spokesperson, usually the most senior national partner.
•	Preparing honest and open lines of communication to help stop rumours.
•	Immediately notifying senior leaders of the situation, especially the mission organization management, if finances are required.
•	Communicate and negotiate with stakeholders for a solution plan. 
•	Under special circumstances considering an appropriate plan to involve the media.
Wherever possible the mission organization will provide the most secure online systems to protect any data that is collected from both the church partners and Pioneers.
Risks can come from either internal or external sources. Betrayal is one of the worst examples. Yet petty wrongdoings such as the misuse of money and time happen almost without exception. The reality is most Projects will have a "Judas" at some point during its lifetime.
It is the team members responsibility to immediately report an incident. Reports are escalated to higher authorities. This allows the senior leaders to advise and deal with the matter. Failure to report a mistake will be dealt with more severely than an honest mistake reported promptly.

### Managing Risks 
Anticipating an avoidable crisis through risk management is the responsibility of all parties, especially the Project Managers. Risk management includes:
•	Protecting the personal data of Pioneers and church partners.
•	Storing money securely in safes and banks wherever possible.
•	Securing equipment and technology in lockable areas or buildings.
•	Paying attention to news about national conflicts or threats to the Project.
•	Anticipating local problems that may occur due to the people and/or their issues.
•	Assessing the threat of these issues by consulting with trusted national advisors.
•	Reporting risks and mistakes and providing new policies to avoid repeating them.    

## Handing Over 
The purpose of the Mission Project is to promote the movement of evangelism within a nation. Therefore, the mission organization must hand over their established churches to the local churches. This allows them to pioneer a new mission field and continue the movement of evangelism resulting in greater spiritual victory. The mission organization must hand over the ministry without any reservation. They must sacrificially pass on everything to local churches and Pioneers in the expectation that they too will do the same in the future. This will enable the continuation of succession. 
Sacrificial Succession is the spiritual platform for a Project. We practice the biblical process of multiplication by handing over leadership, one generation to the next. This is the goal of the Pioneer Project.

## Exit Strategy
It is the mission organization’s responsibility to successfully hand over a Project. Due to the large scale of Projects, the hand over procedure is quite involved. It involves the Pioneers and church partners, national leadership, legal structures, office infrastructure and equipment. 
The main principle of a mission organization exit strategy is to be a blessing not a burden to Successors. Therefore, the process needs to be as efficient and effective as possible. To achieve this, good financial, spiritual and administrative record keeping is required throughout the life of the Project. 
The timing of an exit strategy must incorporate three main factors:
•	Spiritual Viability of the Indigenous Church Planted
•	Financial Sustainability of the National Movement
•	Divestment of the Mission Organization's Legal Obligations and Assets 

### Spiritual Viability and Financial Sustainability 
Confirming the spiritual viability of an indigenous church plant is mainly a spiritual exercise. However, reviewing mission effectiveness data and comparing it with testimonies can also help with this assessment. This can be done through tracking and comparing:
Finances – Decreasing mission organization finance in relation to increasing local support
Evangelism – The number of people introduced to Jesus
Discipleship – The number of people truly following Christ
Multiplication – The number of pastoral replacements and Pioneer Successors  
Sustainability – The number of indigenous churches that are spiritually and financially sustainable 
Tracking mission effectiveness over the life of a Project helps identify areas that need to be addressed.
A detailed Pioneer Project Effectiveness Report will be provided during training. 

### Audit Reporting
Another way we strive towards good stewardship is by routinely auditing resources and assets to achieve mission effectiveness. An audit systematically examines and verifies a Project's financial records and other relevant administrative documents. It's accompanied by a physical inspection of inventory such as asset lists of equipment. 

### Audit assets include: 
Facilities – Buildings and land, plus office furniture stored within them. 
Equipment – Computers, phones and other technology items or tools.
Transport – Vehicles owned or leased through the Project. 
Systems – Financial and administrative hardware and software.
Legal – Entities such as companies or churches that support the Project. 
Income – Money or other services received from local entities. 
Personnel – Foreigner and /or national working with and for the Project.

### Legal and Financial Obligations 
The mission organization will endeavour to ensure that what is left behind for the owners of the Pioneer Project is a legacy that blesses and benefits the movement for Christ, rather than one that incurs costs or becomes a burden. Therefore, during a Project’s transition, mission organization management will endeavour to change the legal status including: decommissioning, deregistering, shutting down, selling or giving away any entities or assets that could become a burden rather than a blessing to the local church.         

### Managing Succession 
The purpose of managing the succession is to ensure that it is beneficial to our partners. Therefore, a management succession plan is applied. This plan incorporates the timeframe and process for authority to be handed over to national leadership. 
Managing succession involves replacing leadership positions within the Project. The Pioneer must prepare at least two Successors in a three-year period. Likewise, each Project Manager must do the same.  The “put last first” principle is applied to all leadership levels.      
The succession planning process also helps identify and develop internal personnel with the potential to fill leadership positions within the Project. 

### Succession Event
The succession event for a Project is usually a formal handover ceremony. During this event, National Partners who have played key roles in impacting a nation are recognized. In the Spirit, it is similar to a pastors’ ordination. It is anointed and carried out to encourage and empower the local Pioneers and churches to continue their good works. Invited guests include predecessors, Successors and special guests. The purpose of a succession event is to promote communication between the church partners and Pioneers. To show the beautiful fruit of cooperation before men. To witness what God has done through the Church. To impact local churches to evangelize. Finally, to display the manifold wisdom of God.  
The event assists the local Pioneers and Successors to receive a favorable spiritual inheritance which will benefit their indigenous mission works. 
A succession ceremony is a formal event.  An opportunity to honour those who have served, sacrificed and sustained Successors from an impacted nation. Invitees include:
•	Church Partners and Pastors of Indigenous Church Plants
•	National Pioneers and their Successors
•	National Partners who have contributed to the success of the Project
•	Potential National Partners who through invitation might want to join the Project
•	Government or church officials who have or may support this Project in the future
Other than this group of invitees, mission organization senior management may also attend. 
A detailed event management check list can be provided for preparation and budgeting purposes. The mission organization can provide teams to help with logistics as well as documenting the succession event. 
Be aware, because many attendees have busy schedules it is important to plan this event well in advance especially if there are cultural or government protocols that require visas and other special documents for entry into that country. Security is an important aspect. Also, to factor in the standard of accommodation for foreign guests and national dignitaries. 
The mission organization will cover most of the overseas travel expenses, but also anticipate that Pioneers and church partners will sacrificially contribute to make the event ceremony. 
Managing this event requires the Project Manager, church partners and mission organization teams to work closely together.  

## Conclusion
The Bible is the manuscript of an amazing adventure. As we read we discover that we are not just spectators of the great drama unfolding but in fact participants. Participants in a fight between the Kingdoms of good and evil. To play the role well in this drama we must submit to the “Director’s” (Holy Spirit) lead into the role He desired us to play. 

God is at work throughout the world, yesterday, today, and tomorrow. We must follow Jesus’s commandment to each one of us to spread the words of Truth that He is the Savior of the world. We must labor in this great end time harvest season to bring souls to His Kingdom.  
Jesus also said that one day soon He will conquer all who oppose Him and establish His Kingdom on the earth. As we wait for the return of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we must ask ourselves what are we called to do today to see His Kingdom come?  You might be asking, ‘Who am I?’, ‘What can I do?  I haven’t been to Bible College. I’m not a pastor. I’m just a businessman, a teacher, a mum. But the bible tells us, no matter what your background, education or skills, if you are willing to be used by the Lord, you will always find a place in His plan. 
God doesn't require perfection. If He did no one could do His will. God however, opens the door for obedient children with a heart to serve Him. All the tests and trials you endure along the way are part of His refining process, to build greater faith, love, endurance and determination to equip you to enter your destiny.  However, once a person enters into their destiny, it does not mean they are perfect, they can still sin or fall short, king David is a perfect example. Therefore, don’t wait until you are perfect than serve God, just do it. The Lord will refine you alone the way. This is God's plan to prosper man. It can be a narrow road paved with challenge or loneliness. But the love and blessing you receive from God far outweigh anything this world has to offer, therefore making every hardship and tear worth it!
The Lord's calling for the church and individuals will always be the same as the last words He spoke to His disciples: “Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit (Matthew 28:19)”.
