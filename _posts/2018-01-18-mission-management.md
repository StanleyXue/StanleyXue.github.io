## The Importance of Management 
A successful business cannot be separated from its excellent management. Likewise, a successful mission is reflective of its effective management. The management system aids the success and speed of a mission project's development.
Mission Management operates with church partnership. A mission organization is not a church and therefore needs the church. This joint collaboration is built upon biblical principles. Scripture states: “so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places” (Ephesians3:10).

## Purpose of Management 
The purpose of management is to be good stewards and gain maximum return for the kingdom. This empowers the mission for sustainability and growth. Scripture reminds us: “Everyone to whom much was given, of him much will be required: and from him to whom they entrusted much, they will demand the more.” (Luke 12:48)  
The Pioneers goal is not only to establish churches in a nation but to ultimately entrust the church to local leadership. The practical outworking of Sacrificial Succession requires three major factors. Good stewardship, church cooperation and a Pioneer’s calling.
  
### When Does Management Begin?
Management begins as soon as the Mission Project starts. Management is responsible for: a research plan, spiritual confirmation of the correct timing to initiate a project, confirmation of church partnership, running a pilot project, confirmation of local church unity, confirmation of the Pioneer's effectiveness, translation of documents, the supply of information and communication technologies, project management, the selection of national leaders, marketing and promotion, project transition and succession ceremony.

### Establish Pioneer Criteria 
•	Which target nation or people group to impact?
•	Support structure from the church partners.
•	Number of supported National Pioneers. 
•	Approved management and transition plan.

### Confirm the Church Partners
Since cooperation with the local church is vital, Mission Management need to confirm the church partner’s relationship. This is done via the following questions:
•	Are you willing to cooperate with us in this Pioneer Project? 
•	How will you cooperate in this Pioneer Project? 
•	How will the Pioneer Project benefit you? 
•	What challenged you to enter into this pioneering work? 

### Project Standard
While each Pioneer Project is unique there is still mission effectiveness criteria that is agreed upon before any project commences:
•	Timeline – Normally a 2-3 year per pioneer cycle with a total of 7 years. 
•	Scope  – Limits the Pioneer Project to impacting a specific country or nation, religious or people group.
•	Resources – Requires at least three forms of partnership: Project Managers, National Partners and Pioneers.     

### Setting Pioneer Target
Depending on the local situation, the Pioneer and board reach an agreement of achievement within a three-year period:  
•	How many areas does each Pioneer need to evangelize?
•	How many people from the target group need to be baptized?
•	How many meeting points should be established and how many people are required to attend?
•	How many Successors need to be trained to pioneer a new field?

## Management Structure
Having a clear management structure where the responsibilities of each partner are clearly defined helps keep everyone accountable and responsible. Within every project there are paid and volunteer roles that are fulfilled by mission organizations and their church partners. 
 
### Staff Structure
Depending on the size and scale of a project these are the main paid and volunteer roles: 
•	National Leaders (Volunteers) – Guide and advocate for the Mission Project to increase its national impact. 
•	Project Manager (Paid) – Leads and manages project at an international or national level. 
•	Project Coordinators (Paid) – Confirm mission effectiveness of National Pioneers and churches.  
•	Church Overseers (Volunteers) – Oversee National Pioneers and provide pastoral support.
•	National Pioneers (Paid) – Evangelize a nation and disciple Pioneer Successors.  

### Staff Requirement
Staff selection requires strong spiritual insight. Trained professionals with spiritual field experience are required to decide who should fill roles. 
Staff need professional training and spiritual experience to work effectively. The mission organization expects the Project Manager to be trustworthy and represent a high standard to all.  
For a Pioneers Project to be effective three key roles must be filled:
•	Staff from the pioneering organization who are spiritually and professionally able to manage a Mission Project.
•	Church partners who can oversee National Pioneers and the churches they plant.
•	National Pioneers who have proven their character, calling and commitment to pioneering.
 
### Volunteer Expert Advisors
Another vital role church partners play is offering expert advice in different fields. They can advise in matters of business and law, pastoral ministry and pioneering work as well as education and training. Church partners assist with the spiritual, educational and economic sustainability of a Mission Project. 
In most cases Volunteer National Advisors are drawn directly from the churches that partner with the mission organization. Their business, educational and spiritual wisdom and experience are invaluable. 

### Employment and Wages 
Paid personnel are supported based on the normal pay for that role minus 20%. The aim of paying less than the full amount is to encourage the church partners to provide the difference. 
Each supported Pioneer must be recruited by the Pioneer organization and overseen by a local church partner. A national leadership is then specifically formed to guide the Mission Project.

### Supporting Standard
First year Pioneers will receive 100% support. This support is reduced to 80% in the second year and 60% in the third. The reason for this is to cultivate local support from the church. When the mission organization leaves a nation, the Project will need to be self-sustaining to continue their pioneering work. 
If a Pioneer doesn't reach the set target the mission organization's support ends after the three-year period.
For a Pioneer who only reached the minimum target the mission organization will support 60% for a fourth year only. This is especially so if the Pioneer feels called to become a pastor. 
But if in three years the agreed target has doubled the mission organization will give 100% support in the second three-year cycle. An example of this would be a minimum of 24 people being baptised, 40 people attending meetings, 2 Successors and the Pioneers willing to step out and pioneer a new area. Finally, the respective church would be willing to release them for a new work.

### Structure and Function  
It is important to understand the way different personnel interact. Pioneering Projects run on the principle of “mutual accountability’. This means total transparency regarding both the cost of the project and the accountability of those involved.
