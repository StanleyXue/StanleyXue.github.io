## About the author 

Xing Xing was born in China, and migrated to America in 1981, then to Australia in 1993. She holds a Bachelor Degree of Management and International Business (with Dean's commendation) from the University of Sunshine Coast Queensland. A Diploma in Theology from Brisbane School of Theology.

She served in a mission organization for ten years, with the first five years as an evangelical shortwave radio broadcaster in the Chinese Language. As the organization transitioned into producing evangelical short film, over the next five years, she was positioned in relationship development with listeners and audience, and saw many of them commit to Christ, during this time she also scripted and produced a number of short films aimed at Chinese people through social media. Her role then changed to promoting the content through the Local Church Community travelling in Australia and China.
